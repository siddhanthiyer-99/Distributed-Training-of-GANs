<h1>Distributed training of GANs</h1>

<h3> <u> OVERVIEW: </u> </h3>
We implement different training strategies for creating a Generator to build fake abstract art images. <br>
We profile different training methods to understand the bottleneck in our training pipeline. <br>
We implement training strategies to help improve these bottlenecks to improve the training speed while maintaining the quality of our GANs. <br>
